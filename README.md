# clj-http

Connect to Hall (http://hall.com) from Clojure.

## Usage

First, copy `bashrc.example` to `bashrc` and modify to your needs. Then, run
`source bashrc` to set environment variables.

Next, you can run `lein run` to run a test script which will use your
environment variables.

Following is an example script you can use to try out clj-hall.

    (ns sample.core
      (:require [clj-hall.core :as hall]))

    (defn -main
      [& args]
      (let [options {:callbacks {:on-open #(println "CALLBACK open")
                                 :on-close #(println "CALLBACK closed")
                                 :on-message #(println "CALLBACK message" %)
                                 :on-error #(println "CALLBACK error" %)}}
            room-id (hall/get-test-room-id)

            ; Construct a client object and connect to Hall
            client (->> (hall/client options) hall/connect!)]

        ; Fetch a list of group rooms
        (println "group rooms" (hall/rooms-request! client))

        ; Fetch a list of room members for a room
        (println "room members" (hall/room-members-request! room-id client))

        ; Fetch a list of pair rooms
        (println "pair rooms" (hall/chats-request! client))

        ; Send a message to a group room
        (println (hall/send-message client
                                    room-id
                                    "group"
                                    "Hello, world!"))))
